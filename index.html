                <p>
                    I am a mostly self-taught developer who is currently studying at <emph>The Open University</emph>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my own spare time, I like to write code and break apart binaries to figure out how they work and more. A lot of my projects focus around the <emph>Xbox</emph> platform due to my curiosity with the <emph>operating system</emph> and my love for <emph>modding</emph> - even with video games.

                                This project was written after reverse engineering the <emph>XVDD.sys</emph> driver that is included in the <emph>GamingServices</emph> package for Windows 10. The original goal was to be able to modify <emph>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</emph> but due to the nature of 
                                MSIXVC packages; accessing game data is not possible without decrypting and extracting the data. 
                                Therefore, I created a memory dump of a virtual machine and captured the license information belonging to the title. 
                                This lead to the discovery of a <emph>Key Slot</emph> table belonging in the XVDD memory region. 
                                Utilising <emph>Kernel-Bridge</emph>, I was able to seamlessly iterate and locate key data in the kernel memory region through the command line.

                                A small script written to parse and extract the individual <emph>Windows PE</emph> files within the <emph>VBI</emph>> binary. This file was located in the user-data section of an operating system XVD on the Xbox One console.
                                Further analysis revealed that this binary contained <emph>critical boot</emph> components: such as the kernel and other important drivers found on Windows.
